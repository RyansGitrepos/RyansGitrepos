# Hello, World! 👋

I'm Riaan, a cloud enthusiast who is passionate about automating all the things. I spend most of my time working with **Azure DevOps**, **Bicep**, and **Azure Infrastructure as Code**. 

## 🚀 About Me

I believe in the power of code, especially when it comes to infrastructure. Why manually create and manage resources when you can code it? That's where my love for Azure DevOps and Bicep comes in. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Here are a few things I've picked up along my learning journey:

- **Azure DevOps**: Automating builds and deployments? Count me in!
- **Bicep**: My go-to language for defining resources in Azure.
- **Azure Infrastructure as Code**: Because who wants to manually manage resources?
- **Azure Architecture**: I'm an Azure Architect who loves building scalable, reliable, and secure cloud solutions using the latest best practices.
- **Azure Networking**: As a networking enthusiast, I specialize in setting up and managing Azure's virtual networks, subnets, and security solutions like Azure Firewall.


## 🎯 Goals for 2024

- Become an Azure DevOps Champion
- Contribute to the Bicep GitHub repository
